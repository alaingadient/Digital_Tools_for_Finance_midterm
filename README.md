which of the G10 currencies is the riskiest to hold for a Swiss resident?
====

Our project is about finding which will be the riskiest currencies, in term of an Riskmeassure, for a Swiss citizen who has CHF and has the G10 curencies (expect Switzerland) to choose.
The Riskmeassures we will use are Expected Shortfall and Variance

How to do it:
---
Compute the variance and Expected shortfall of the G10 curency to the swiss curency. 

Now compare them and show if there is some difference with the two risk measures. 

Also a plot of the timeseries will be shown to compare them.

The results will be shown in a Latex presentation and a Document.
